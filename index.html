            <p class='about'>
                I created this quiz for the <a href='http://cssday.nl'>CSS Day</a> conference where I did a
                talk about &lt;noscript>. Halfway through I discovered <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/htmlquiz?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash'>#HTMLQuiz</a> on Twitter by
                <a href='https://twitter.com/RReverser'>Ingvar Stepanyan</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/zcorpan'>Simon Pieters</a>.
                Of course, being the lazy bastard that I am, I immediately
                <del>shamelessly stole all of their ideas</del> used it for inspiration.
                And thanks to Simon Pieters for checking all of these questions! Have fun and tweet the results (no cheating)!
